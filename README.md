I am 35 years old. I moved close to the nature from the city 1 year ago with my wife. 
Carco is my artist name, which I got as a techno musician (2001-2008). My real name is Charles. 
Since I was 8, I have been using computers to create with a variety of media: music, graphics, 3d, animations, software. 
In addition to digital creations, I was lucky enough to learn painting from a real master on paintings for 1 year, so if my time allows I paint. 
I go to drum lesson once a week just for fun.
My son will be born soon!:baby:
